The application is using the Foursquare API to find "food" venues in Montreal and adds markers to a google map and a list of the found venues

Enjoy the app either cloning the this github repo or visit http://roscaiosif.github.io
- Using the the catogory options it is possible to select one or multiple categories
- Clicking the marker or a list-view item will bring up a google infowindow with some more information
- There are up to ten pictures stored for each location that can be visualized by succesive clicks either on the marker or on the list-view item
